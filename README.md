# ISF Advisors - isfadvisors.org

This repo contains the source code and documentation powering isfadvisors.org, based on the Axel Framework.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as a static site generator, and [Netlify](netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
* [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

### Run Locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SpokeLLC/isfadvisors.org-test.git
cd isfadvisors.org-test
npm install
gatsby develop
```

Site will run locally on localhost:8000
